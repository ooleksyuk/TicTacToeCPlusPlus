## Tic Tac Toe

This is a Tic Tac Toe game for two players for 16 squares.

To start a game clone the repo and in the console go to the repo,
type `./main`, this will start a compiled version of the game.

You'll be promted to enter names for two players.
The game is using two coordinates for making a move `(x, y)`.

The Gameboard looks like this:
 |0|1|2|3_____x
0|_|_|_|_
1|_|_|_|_
2|_|_|_|_
3|_|_|_|_
 |
y

First you'll be prompted to enter `x`, than `y`.

By entering x = 0, y = 2 you'll get:
_|0|1|2|3
0|_|_|x|_

I am working to improve the game by outputting layout of the game board before each move. TBD.
